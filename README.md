##Summary
<p>This is a Java application tool to design castle layouts for the game http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/.<p/>
<p>Designs are saved as images for easy access, and barcoded to allow the image to be loaded. An alphanumeric version of the barcode can also be exported/imported.</p>

##Details

*Buildings are placed quickly and efficiently by dragging the mouse.
*Buildings can be removed in the same way with the right mouse button.
*Designs are saved in a lossless png format.
*The saved images can be reloaded back into the designer since each image has its information barcoded for forwards compatibility.
*For when images cannot be used (such as the Stronghold Kingdoms ingame mail system), an alphanumeric version of the barcode may be accessed.
